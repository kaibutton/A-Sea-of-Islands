# A-Sea-of-Islands
ICS 311 | Assignment 5


Guidelines for graph representing the collection of islands:
1. Nodes are Islands, directed edges are paths between islands (by canoe)
2. Edge weights represent traversal time can can only be positive
3. Not every island has a path to every other island
4. Weight of AB may be different from BA

Island Characteristics:
1. # of people
2. At least 3 different resource types


Traversal Characteristics:
1. Canoe's have limited cargo capacity
2. Canoe count may be limited
3. Canoes can only hold one resource type
4. To completely distribute a resource, canoes may have to return to the source of the resource

For each scenario, include:
1. A description of the algorithm used to implement the solution
2. Source code of algorithm that computes the most efficient solution
